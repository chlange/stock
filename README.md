stock
=====

A game facing the tough and obscure world of stock exchange. Levels, Events, Environments, Tradables, you will love it!

What's done?
============
	- Logic of the game is 95% finished.
		(1% for a small issue and 4% for the derivates bet system)
	- Well documented classes and their interaction. (Javadoc)
	- (Documented) Interface for level contributors. 
		The community should develop levels for the game.
	- Unit tests are complete.
	- Small sample CLI game ready.
					
What's missing?
===============

	- One (really!) small issue (Issue #1) must be fixed.
	- An easy-to-use bet system for derivates must be implemented, which could cost some brain cells! (Issue #2)
		A developer should be able to create bet options on stocks (and maybe more...) easily 
		(i.e. the percental increase of a stock until tomorrow, the stock value after three days, ...).
	- A plugin system would be nice, but I wasn't completely happy with my solutions.
		Interfaces for the community are awesome but I think this may be impossible.
	- The most important thing is a GUI!
		I tried to implement a wrapper class for informaton output so further developers can 
		build fantastic GUI's without significant code changes.
		But I never created a GUI. This wrapper class could be a blessing or curse.

What would be nice?
===================

	- Split same tradables in game overview .
		I bought a stock for 1 Euro and bought same stock for 2 Euro later.
		Adding the amount
